The Crowne Plaza in Nairobi was worked on by our international team, and covered 144 keys.
Its stunning bespoke ringed chandelier was installed by iField experts.
With rings going up to 3m in diameter, it brings out the luminous luxury of this marvellous hotel.
We also created magic glass screens that switch between frosted and transparent at the touch of a button.
