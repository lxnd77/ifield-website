The gorgeous Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja is one of our proudest achievements.
This 250-key project includes 200 standard rooms, presidential and vice presidential suites, a specialty restaurant, and an azure pool bar.
This hotel became an iField project because the Marriott Office in the UK recommended our services to the owners at the SIFAX group.
It continues to be an icon in the hospitality industry in its region.
